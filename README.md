DNS
===

This project is an educational DNS client/server used in the Network Programming class at
Vermont Technical College. It is intended to (eventually) be a full featured system with an
emphasis on being easy to understand and modify. Performance is not a priority, although
building a high performance system has educational merit as well and this is not completely off
the table.
